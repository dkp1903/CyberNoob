# CyberNoob

CyberNoob provides CyberSecurity based training and products. The project is an Android portfolio application for CyberNoob. 

I plan to implement a few activities, a login page, a custom form for queries. Since scalability is presumed to be a later concern,
I will use Firebase as the database as well as for authentication.
